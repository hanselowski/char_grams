the father tongue hypothesis proposes that humans tend to speak their
it is based on proposal that linguistic affiliation correlates more closely with variation than with mitochondrial dna
the initial work was performed on african and european samples by team of population geneticists led by laurent
on the basis of these and similar findings by other the hypothesis was elaborated by historical linguist george van driem in that the teaching by mother of her tongue to her children is mechanism by which language has preferentially been spread over
focusing on prehistoric language shift in already settled examples worldwide show that as little as of prehistoric male immigration can cause language indicating an elite imposition such as may have happened with the appearance of the first farmers or metalworkers in the bronze and iron
before the discovery of mtdna variation and variation in the and it was not possible to distinguish male from female effects in population
researchers had to rely on autosomal starting with the first population genetic study using blood groups by ludwik hirszfeld in
later other genetic polymorphisms were for example polymorphisms of proteins of the blood polymorphisms of human lymphocyte antigens or polymorphisms of
on this correlations between languages and genetic variation occasionally were but questions could not be addressed until the when both mtdna and variation in humans became available for
the chromosome follows patrilineal meaning it is only passed on among from father to
mitochondrial dna on the other hand follows matrilineal meaning it is only passed on from the mother to her children and from her daughters to their
in laurent his student estella poloni and his team reported that they had found strong correlation between the sequence variation and while not being able to find such correspondence for the mtdna
proposed the possible consequences of such
estella poloni also presented the father tongue hypothesis at an international conference in paris in april
on the basis of this population genetic historical linguist george van driem elaborated the father tongue hypothesis in his ethnolinguistic publications and in population genetic publications which he has
at the prehistory association conference in taipei in he proposed that
the next development was the discovery of specific markers linked to
these variants do not cause language but happened to be carried by the historic or prehistoric male speakers spreading the
these markers create correlations such as those observed by poloni et
and furthermore allow the geographic the time depth and the male immigration level underlying an unrecorded language change to be
there are several salient examples where the prehistoric diffusion of language family correlates strongly with the diffusion of
the father tongue hypothesis has implications for several processes in linguistics such as language language acquisition and
the father tongue hypothesis also has implications for language as the hypothesis suggests an evolutionary explanation for why females may be better in some aspects of language performance and
the historical linguist george van driem interpreted the correlation of haplogroups and language families as indicating that the spread of language families was often mediated by whether these intrusions were martial or something less
he conjectured that the majority of language communities spoke father tongues rather than mother
the father tongue hypothesis has implications for understanding of language
it must be assumed that the dynamics of language change whereby mothers pass on the language of their spouses to their offspring differ from the dynamics of language change in monolingual community and even from the dynamics of change in bilingual community where mothers pass on their own language to their
as such dynamics can introduce discontinuity with the
for it has been observed that genetically an algonquian was relexified by métis women with métis the language of their and so the genetic affinity of michif has come to be almost
if the process of relexification went beyond the possibility of linguistic the dynamics of such process may obscure the true linguistic heritance of
genetics does not determine the language spoken by human and the link between haplogroups and linguistic affinities is an observed correlation and not causal
while father tongues exceptions to father tongues exist in the
two very exceptions are the balti in northern pakistan and
the mtdna haplogroups most frequent among balti are the same as those of the neighbouring tibetan whereas the haplogroups most frequent in balti males appear to have entered baltistan from the west with the introduction of
the balti speak one of the most conservative tibetan
the language of the balti corresponds to the mtdna and not to the chromosome and is in effect salient example of mother
the other exception is
the haplogroup of the distinguished by is found at high frequency throughout uralic language but is virtually missing in hungarian
while the intrusion of the magyars into what is today hungary is historically attested and has left clear linguistic genetically the magyar intrusion has left no salient genetic

in july the phase extension was announced as being fully funded with billion in commitments from the and federal
the project is expect to begin construction once the capital line extension business case has been approved by the government of treasury
in may due to budget the plan for an elevated crossing over ellerslie road along with an elevated heritage valley north station was changed to an crossing and an at grade
future crossing and station will be studied and would be part of the second extension phase if
other alternatives considered included the deferral of the twin brooks station to future project and changing the material of sound barrier from wood to brick or similar

soon after the process of independence various foreign artists came to chile on scientific expeditions and to make bringing with them their tastes and thematic that would go on to influence the future direction of chilean

the popular painter was dedicated to painting portraits of the leaders of the revolution against the such as ramón bernardo isabel josé de san martín and simón
his technique largely resembles the cuzco school so his portrayal of faces was not particularly appearing flat and lacking in
regardless of his skill as portrait the decorative details of his work are appreciated by ricardo bindis in his book of chilean who praises the way the artist treated the medals and other details present on the caudillos and revolution
another foreign painter of great importance to the newly formed nation was charles an english painter who specialised in nautical scenes and contributed large collection of paintings of remarkable historical
among his most famous works are del de la fragata esmeralda por la escuadra de chile de lord and general baquedano en

the end of this artistic era was marked by the founding of the new chilean academy of painting in which allowed artists to study in chile for the first time rather than having to travel to
although the chilean academy did not see the fruits of its labour until well into the its importance for chilean art become noticeable in the generation labelled by as the del medio
the academy of santiago was the first institution to teach art professionally in
it opened on march and was sponsored by the government of manuel bulnes as part of state plan to promote fine art and other intellectual activities to the young chilean
in this the university of chile was also founded along with the school of arts and the conservatory of music and architecture and sculpture classes at the university of under the direction of french architect françois brunet debaines and french sculptor auguste françois
the academy was originally located in the building belonging to the san felipe in what is today the municipal theatre of
various changes led the academy to merge with the museo nacional de bellas artes in and then later to hand its administration over to the university of chile in
the academy would produce the first national
it would be the starting point for some of the most prominent chilean including the four great masters of chilean their and also the future del
the first directors were the neapolitan artist the german artist ernst the florentine juan cosme san the first chilean to hold this and the chilean sculptor virginio

the chilean academies tried to implement this idea using french

after the academy joined forces with the national courses were extended and more teachers were taken on due to the growing number of
despite the significance of the some art historians criticised this period as one of the dullest in the history of chilean
these authors based their criticism on attempt to copy the european model of
in teachers were plentiful and the continent had vast art collections and plentiful patrons to draw
in chile had only recently began its foray in the art world and was country with almost no native art movement or established national as well as very modest national art with people unable to afford fine
the attempt to bring the european model to chile by replicating its techniques has been seen as failure in terms of the number of artists especially for who presided over the academy for over
in the words of the art ciccarelli
the same author states that ciccarelli was unable to create the following and discipleship of his teachings that he wished
his most successful such as pedro lira and antonio did not care for his teachings and migrated towards other styles and workshops of their
pedro lira also agreed that with these criticisms of
in the the chilean aristocrat possessed little artistic knowledge inherited from the of chilean
the complicated nature of his his neoclassical and his lack of flexibility earned him criticism from several of his but it also created new appetite for neoclassical painting in
the outdated neoclassical style developed by ciccarelli and imposed on his students is manifested in themes which had never been seen before in chilean like ancient history and the
some of his students resisted his the most prominent being pedro lira and antonio independent of their studies at the developed their own style and gained great

the and therefore painting and became privilege for the upper with pictures that could only be understood by having already seen the work of the european
for this meant that while the early years of the academy saw the first effort made in chile to improve the quality of the they were also springboard for several independent artists who tired of academic dogmatism and started to look elsewhere for new techniques and
the academy left legacy of students who awoke in society an intellectual interest in chilean with groups like and great chilean formed mostly by academy
many of the works produced at the academy are now in the hands of private but are also displayed in chilean museums and public spaces throughout the
the art historian antonio romera highlights the four most prominent and important painters in the development of chilean art in the late and early

this became defining image of lu

he said of lu it is it is and it is
this came to be known as the 三个冷静 of lu
writing of this review was both beautiful and rarity for critical
he attached great importance to objectivity while writing
at the end of the he related story from anatole france to remind the reader that review critiques the writing objectively and not the writer
zhang mengyang 张梦阳 of the chinese academy of social sciences published an essay century of the study of lu in which he says about lu review is without doubt the first substantial essay about lu
it shaped the initial impression of his
the most important and the deepest contribution is the accurate description of the general spiritual and cultural transition represented by lu

in computer the problem involves maintaining totally ordered set supporting the following
paul dietz first introduced data structure to solve this problem in
structure supports in
amortized time and in constant time but does
athanasios tsakalidis used bbα trees with the same performance bounds that supports
deletion in and improved insertion and deletion performance to
amortized time with
dietz and daniel sleator published an improvement to constant time in
michael richard cole and jack zito published significantly simplified alternatives in
kopelowitz and montes also published deamortized solution in
efficient data structures for have applications in
many including data structure graph algorithms and data
problem related to the problem is the
problem in which instead of the operation the solution must maintain an assignment of labels
elements of the set such that precedes in the total order if and
only if is assigned lesser label than
operation returning the label of any node
solution to the problem immediately gives one to the
in most solutions to the
problem are solutions to the problem
augmented with level of data structure indirection to improve
we will see an example of this
for problem on sets of size up to the cost of list labeling depends on how large is function of
the relevant parameter range for order maintenance are for for which an amortized cost solution is and for which constant time amortized solution is known
indirection is technique used in data structures in which problem
is split into multiple levels of data structure in order to improve
problem of size is split into
this technique is used in
strategy also works to improve the insertion and deletion performance
of the data structure described above to constant amortized
this strategy works for any solution of the
problem with amortized insertion and deletion
the new data structure is completely rebuilt whenever it grows too
let be the number of elements of
the total order when it was last
violated by an insertion or
since rebuilding can be done in
linear time this does not affect the amortized performance of
during the rebuilding the elements of the
each of size
the list labeling problem is solved on the set
the sublists in their original list
the labels for this subproblem are taken to be polynomial say so that they can be compared in constant time and updated in amortized
list of its elements is built storing with each element
pointer to its representative in the tree as well as local integer
the local integer labels are also taken from range so that the can be compared in constant but because each local problem involves only the labels range is exponential in the number of items being
they can be updated in amortized
see the problem for details of both
answered by first checking if the two nodes are in the same
if their order can be determined by comparing their local
otherwise the labels of their representatives in the first problem are
given new sublist node for and pointer to the sublist node
inserts immediately after in the sublist
of if there is room for in the that is if the length of the list is no greater than after the
local label is given by the local list labeling algorithm for exponential
this case takes amortized
if the local list it is split evenly into two lists of size and the items in each list are given new labels from their
this creates new which is inserted into the list of and the new sublist node is given label in the list of sublists by the
finally is inserted into the appropriate
this sequence of operations take but there have been insertions since the list was created or last
thus the amortized time per insertion is
given sublist node to be simply
removes from its sublist in constant
sublist then we need to remove the representative of the
elements were deleted from the sublist since it was first built we can afford to spend the the amortized cost of deletion is

the lactate shuttle hypothesis describes the movement of lactate intracellularly and
the hypothesis is based on the observation that lactate is formed and utilized continuously in diverse cells under both anaerobic and aerobic
lactate produced at sites with high rates of glycolysis and glycogenolysis can be shuttled to adjacent or remote sites including heart or skeletal muscles where the lactate can be used as gluconeogenic precursor or substrate for
the hypothesis was proposed by professor george brooks of the university of california at
in addition to its role as fuel source predominantly in the and the lactate shuttle hypothesis also relates the role of lactate in redox gene and lipolytic
these additional roles of lactate have given rise to the term pertaining to the role of lactate as signalling
prior to the formation of the lactate shuttle lactate had long been considered byproduct resulting from glucose breakdown through glycolysis in times of anaerobic
as means of regenerating oxidized lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the oxidizing nadh to regenerating the necessary substrate needed to continue
lactate is then transported from the peripheral tissues to the liver by means of the cori cycle where it is reformed into pyruvate through the reverse reaction using lactate
by this lactate was traditionally considered toxic metabolic byproduct that could give rise to fatigue and muscle pain during times of anaerobic
lactate was essentially payment for defined by hill and lupton as the amount of oxygen after cessation of exercise in recovery
in addition to cori the lactate shuttle hypothesis proposes complementary functions of lactate in multiple
contrary to the belief that lactate is formed as result of substantial evidence exists that suggests lactate is formed under both aerobic and anaerobic as result of substrate supply and equilibrium
during physical exertion or moderate intensity exercise lactate released from working muscle and other tissue beds is the primary fuel source for the exiting the muscles through monocarboxylate transport
this evidence is supported by an increased amount of mct shuttle proteins in the heart and muscle in direct proportion to exertion as measured through muscular
both neurons and astrocytes have been shown to express mct suggesting that the lactate shuttle may be involved in brain
astrocytes express low affinity transporter for suggesting its function is to export lactate produced by
neurons express high affinity transporter for
it is hypothesized that the astrocytes produce lactate which is then taken up by the adjacent neurons and oxidized for
the lactate shuttle hypothesis also explains the balance of lactate production in the via glycolysis or and lactate oxidation in the
transporters within the peroxisome function to transport pyruvate into the peroxisome where it is reduced by peroxisomal ldh to
in nadh is converted to regenerating this necessary component for subsequent
lactate is then shuttled out of the peroxisome via where it is oxidized by cytoplasmic ldh to generating nadh for energy use and completing the
while the cytosolic fermentation pathway of lactate is well novel feature of the lactate shuttle hypothesis is the oxidation of lactate in the
baba and sherma were the first to identify the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase in the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix of rat skeletal and cardiac
ldh was found in the rat and heart
it was also found that lactate could be oxidized as quickly as pyruvate in rat liver
because lactate can either be oxidized in the or serve as gluconeogenic the intracellular lactate shuttle has been proposed to account for the majority of lactate turnover in the human
confirmed this in when they found that lactate oxidation exceeded that of pyruvate by in rat and cardiac
in roth and brooks found evidence for the facilitated transporter of monocarboxylate transport in the sarcolemma vesicles of rat skeletal

the first four mct isoforms are responsible for
was found to be the predominant isoform in many tissues including skeletal and
in skeletal is found in the membranes of the and
because of the mitochondrial localization of and brooks et
proposed the possibility of mitochondrial lactate oxidation complex in
this is supported by the observation that the ability of muscle cells to oxidize lactate was related to the density of
it was shown that training increases protein levels in skeletal muscle and that corresponded with an increase in the ability of muscle to clear lactate from the body during
the affinity of mct for pyruvate is greater than however two reactions will ensure that lactate will be present in concentrations that are orders of magnitude greater than the equilibrium constant of ldh greatly favors the formation of
the immediate removal of pyruvate from the mitochondria ensures that pyruvate is not present in great concentrations within the
ldh isoenzyme expression is
it was found that in was the predominant form in the mitochondria of but was predominant in the liver
it is suspected that this difference in isoenzyme is due to the predominant pathway the lactate will take in liver it is more likely to be whereas in the myocardium it is more likely to be
despite these it is thought that the redox state of the mitochondria dictates the ability of the tissues to oxidize not the particular ldh
as illustrated by the peroxisomal intracellular lactate shuttle described the interconversion of lactate and pyruvate between cellular compartments plays key role in the oxidative state of the
the interconversion of and nadh between compartments has been hypothesized to occur in the
the evidence for this is as both lactate and pyruvate are quickly metabolized inside the
the existence of the peroxisomal lactate shuttle suggests that this redox shuttle could exist for other
increased intracellular levels of lactate can act as signalling inducing changes in gene expression that will upregulate genes involved in lactate
these genes include cytochrome and other enzymes involved in the lactate oxidation
lactate will increase levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator suggesting that lactate stimulates mitochondrial
in addition to the role of the lactate shuttle in supplying substrate for in the the shuttle also regulates ffa mobilization by controlling plasma lactate
research has demonstrated that lactate functions to inhibit lipolysis in fat cells through activation of an orphan couple receptor that acts as lactate inhibiting lipolysis in response to
as found by et while lactate is disposed of mainly through oxidation and only minor fraction supports lactate is the main gluconeogenic precursor during sustained
brooks demonstrated in his earlier studies that little difference in lactate production rates were seen in trained and untrained subjects at equivalent power
what was was more efficient clearance rates of lactate in the trained subjects suggesting an upregulation of mct
local lactate use depends on exercise
during approximately of lactate disposal take place through lactate oxidation whereas in time of strenuous exercise approximately of lactate is used by the active indicating role as major contributor to energy conversion during increased exercise
highly malignant tumors rely heavily on anaerobic glycolysis and thus need to efflux lactic acid via mcts to the tumor to maintain robust glycolytic flux and to prevent the tumor from being to
the mcts have been successfully targeted in studies using rnai and inhibitor acid to show that inhibiting lactic acid efflux is very effective therapeutic strategy against highly glycolytic malignant
in some tumor growth and metabolism relies on the exchange of lactate between glycolytic and rapidly respiring
this is of particular importance during tumor cell development when cells often undergo anaerobic as described by the warburg
other cells in the same tumor may have access to or recruit sources of allowing it to undergo aerobic
the lactate shuttle could occur as the hypoxic cells anaerobically metabolize glucose and shuttle the lactate via mct to the adjacent cells capable of using the lactate as substrate for
investigation into how lactate exchange in targeted tumor cells can be therefore depriving cells of key energy could lead to promising new
lactate has been shown to be key factor in tumor

cgamp produced by cgas contains mixed phosphodiester with one between of gmp and of amp and the other between of amp and of
this referred to as functions as an endogenous second messenger inducing type interferon
cgamp has also been shown to be an effective adjuvant that boosts the production of antibodies and cell responses in
cgamp exercises antiviral functions in the cell where it is but can also cross cell membranes by passive diffusion through gap junctions to exert effects on neighboring
it may even be packaged into poxvirus and herpes and under cell culture conditions has been found to transmit an antiviral signal to the cells infected with these there is reason to think that at least hiv is capable of evading this mechanism by some

large roman landowners increasingly relied on roman acting as tenant to provide
the status of these tenant eventually known as steadily
because the tax system implemented by diocletian assessed taxes based both on land and on the inhabitants of that it became administratively inconvenient for peasants to leave the land where the census counted
in ad emperor constantine issued legislation that greatly restricted the rights of the coloni and tied them to the
some see these laws as the beginning of medieval serfdom in
medieval serfdom really began with the breakup of the carolingian empire around the
the demise of this which had ruled much of western europe for more than ushered in long period during which no strong central government existed in most of

the enclosure of manor fields for livestock grazing and for larger arable plots made the economy of small strips of land in open fields less attractive to
the increasing use of money made tenant farming by serfs less for much less than it cost to support lord could now hire workers who were more skilled and pay them in
paid labour was also more since workers could be hired only when they were

serfdom reached eastern europe centuries later than western became dominant around the
before that eastern europe had been much more sparsely populated than western and the lords of eastern europe created environment to encourage migration
serfdom developed in eastern europe after the black death epidemics of the which stopped the eastward
the resulting high ratio combined with eastern sparsely populated areas gave the lords an incentive to bind the remaining peasantry to their

throughout the course of the eastern european ability to move at will decreased
with increased demand for agricultural produce in western europe during the later era when western europe limited and eventually abolished serfdom remained in force throughout eastern europe during the century so that estates could produce more agricultural products for the profitable export
according to jerome the rise of serfdom in eastern europe in the just as serfdom disappeared in western is due to the increasing political influence and economic privileges of the nobles in the and reduced competition for labour from

the cohesive zone model is model in fracture mechanics where fracture formation is regarded as gradual phenomenon and separation of the crack surfaces takes place across an extended crack or cohesive and is resisted by cohesive
the origin of this model can be traced back to the early sixties by dugdale and barenblatt to represent nonlinear processes located at the front of
the major advantages of the czm over the conventional methods in fracture mechanics like those including ctod
another important advantage of czm falls in the conceptual framework for
the cohesive zone model does not represent any physical but describes the cohesive forces which occur when material elements are being pulled
as the surfaces traction first increases until maximum is and then subsequently reduces to zero which results in complete
the variation in traction in relation to displacement is plotted on curve and is called the
the area under this curve is equal to the energy needed for
czm maintains continuity conditions despite physical
it eliminates singularity of stress and limits it to the cohesive strength of the
the curve gives the constitutive behavior of the
for each material guidelines are to be formed and modelling is done
the amount of fracture energy dissipated in the work region depends on the shape of the model
the ratio between the maximum stress and the yield stress affects the length of the fracture process
the smaller the the longer is the process
the czm allows the energy to flow into the fracture process where part of it is spent in the forward region and the rest in the wake
the czm provides an effective methodology to study and simulate fracture in
the dugdale model assumes thin plastic strips of are at the forefront of two mode crack tips in thin plastic
in the case where and therefore the plastic zone size
which is similar but slightly smaller than predicted plastic zone
the general form of the crack tip opening displacement according to the dugdale model at the points and
this can be simplified for cases where
the barenblatt model is analogous to the dugdale but is applied to brittle
this approach considers the interatomic stresses involved but considers large enough area to apply to continuum fracture
model assumes that width of the edge cohesive region of crack is small compared to the size of the whole in addition to the assumption for most fracture mechanics models that the stress fields of all cracks are the same for given specimen geometry regardless of the remote applied
in the barenblatt the is equal to the theoretical bond rupture strength of brittle
this allows the strain energy release to be defined by the critical crack opening or the critical cohesive zone as

the optical stretcher is optical trap that is used for trapping and deforming soft matter such as biological cells in
the forces used for trapping and deforming objects arise from photon momentum transfer on the surface of the making the optical stretcher unlike atomic force microscopy or micropipette aspiration tool for rheology
the trapping of particles by two laser beams was first demonstrated by arthur ashkin in
before he developed the trap now known as optical
an advantage of the design is that no two laser beams need to be exactly adjusted to make their optical axes
from the late optical tweezers have been used to trap and hold biological such as cells or
in order to ensure trap the single beam must be highly with the particle trapped close to the focus
preventing damage done to biological material by the high local light intensities in the focus limits the laser powers that one can use in the optical tweezers to force range too low for rheology
optical tweezers are suitable for trapping biological but unsuitable for deforming
the optical developed at the end of the by jochen guck and josef
circumvents this problem by going back to the design originally developed by
this allows for weakly divergent thus preventing damage done by localized light intensities and increasing the possible stretching forces to range that is sufficient for the deformation of soft
the laser powers used in stretching cells are typically on the order of generating stretch forces on the order of
the resulting relative cellular deformation then usually lies in the range from
the optical stretcher has since been developed into versatile biophysical tool used by many groups worldwide for measurements of
using automated high throughput rates of more than have been allowing for statistical analysis of the
cell mechanics and cell rheology play crucial role in cellular development and also in many
due to its high the optical stretcher has in many biomechanical studies been the tool of choice to investigate the development of or changes in cell among them studies on the development of cancer and stem cell
an exemplary study in stem cell research sheds light on the process of cell hematopoietic stem cells residing in the bone marrow differentiate into different types of blood cells to produce human blood red blood cells and different types of white blood
in this it was shown that the white blood cell types show different mechanical behaviour depending on their later physiological function and that these differences arise during the process of stem cell
using the optical it was also shown that cancerous cells differ significantly in their mechanical properties from their healthy
the authors claim that the can be used as biomechanical marker to distinguish cancerous from healthy and even that higher stages of malignancy can be
typical optical stretcher setup consists of the following main
physical origin of the forces in the optical
objects trapped in the optical stretcher usually have diameters on the scale of which is very large compared to the laser wavelengths
it is thus sufficient to consider the interaction with the laser light in terms of ray
when ray enters the it is refracted due to the different refractive index according to
because photons carry change in the direction of propagation of light ray implies momentum
according to third corresponding force pointing in the opposite direction acts on the surface of the
these surface forces due to photon momentum change are the origin for the ability of the optical stretcher to trap and stretch
all surface forces can be added up to resulting force pulling on the center of mass of the which is used to trap
one uses gaussian laser beams to trap
the most important thing to note is that gaussian beams have light intensity
the light intensity is high in the center of the beam and decreases off the
it can be illustrative to decompose the trapping force into two components called the and the
the rays on the inner side are mostly refracted away from the beam leading to corresponding force towards the beam axis on the
the gradient force thus pulls object onto the beam
this requires the refractive index of that object to be higher than the index of the surrounding medium else the refraction would lead to opposite pushing particles out of the
the refractive index of biological matter is always higher than that of water or cell medium due to the additional protein
in the optical two counterpropagating laser beams are used in order to cancel their corresponding scattering
because their gradient forces point in the same pulling particles towards their common beam they add and one arrives at stable trap
an alternative approach to understand the trapping mechanism is to consider the interaction of the particle with the electric fields of the laser
this leads to the known fact that electric dipoles are pulled to the region of highest field
once the particle is stably there is no net force on the center of mass of the
the forces appearing at the surface of the particle do not and contrary to what one might naively the light does not the cell but
where is the refractive index of the medium and the wavelength of the
the photon momentum when the photon enters medium of higher refractive
conservation of momentum then leads to surface force acting on the pointing in the opposite
when photon leaves the trapped its momentum decreases and again conservation of momentum requires that an force be
as all surface forces point they do not cancel but add
the highest stretching forces can be found on the beam where the light intensity is highest and the rays incide at right
near the poles of the where virtually no rays the surface forces
different mathematical models have been developed to calculate the stretching based on ray optics

it began to gather in the smolny on and its first official meeting was not held
its chair was the left sr turned bolshevik pavel
the following days saw the escalation of the garrison crisis as unit after unit declared their willingness to obey the petrograd with only three of the eighteen garrison representatives expressing confidence in the provisional

bolshevik revolutionary leader joseph stalin pointed out that the military committee was created to guard against by the kerensky and to protect the but this was already significant act of armed insurrection that almost instantly translated into the overthrow of the kerensky
even after the decision was made to overthrow the rhetoric of the bolsheviks focused on defending the democratic gains from kerensky though they were not only planning but also revolutionary characteristic feature of this period is the rapid growth of the the utter consternation reigning among the ruling the isolation of the and and the mass flight of the vacillating elements to the side of the
peculiar feature of the tactics of the revolution in this period must be that the revolution strove to take or nearly step in its attack in the guise of
the refusal to allow the troops to be withdrawn from petrograd was an important step in the this attack was carried out under the slogan of protecting petrograd from possible attack by the external
the formation of the revolutionary military committee was still more important step in the attack upon the provisional it was carried out under the slogan of organising soviet control over the actions of the headquarters of the military

the headquarters of the mrc was located on the third floor of the smolny young
it had seven information reporting and
the department of revolutionary air services was and motor transport allocation section was
the immediate tasks the mrc faced after seizing power from the provisional government were curbing taking control of essential utilities and government preventing pogroms and and above defeating coup attempt by military cadets and fighting the cossacks who were sent by kerensky to retake
shortly after the the mrc found itself dealing with mostly civil administration
the mrc appointed commissars to various civil
the most urgent problem facing the mrc was providing food to the population of
after the october levels of grain stock in petrograd were so low that they were insufficient to supply the city with the daily ration of half pound of bread for even one
the mrc imposed even stricter food controls and sent to the other followed by stiff penalties against possible speculation on the new incoming
